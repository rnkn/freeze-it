# Freeze It #

[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/freeze-it-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/freeze-it)

An Emacs minor mode to kill your inner editor! Every writer struggles to
balance their creative and critical sides, with progress frequently
hindered by the temptation to go back and revise to get things *just
right*.

Freeze It aims to combat this temptation. After an idle delay
`freeze-it-delay` all text between `point-min` and a configurable
distance before `point` will be made read-only.

Option `freeze-it-go-back` controls how far this distance "goes back"
before freezing text. This can be nil, `word`, `line`, `visible-line`,
`line`, or `paragraph`.

Command `freeze-it-show` will momentarily highlight read-only text in
the buffer while there is no user input. The highlighting uses
`freeze-it-show` face and displays for `freeze-it-show-delay` seconds.

Text remains read-only until you kill the buffer, so that you can't
cheat. This is by design, because the minor mode targets the
psychological *temptation* to revise your writing, rather than just the
ability.
